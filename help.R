#' This package is designed to facilitate a more fluid workflow of members of the University of Kentucky's
#' Biostatistics Consulting and Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration Lab (Biostat CIRCL). It serves as a
#' singular place in which all members may add functions they commonly use for a variety of analyses.
#'
#' The goal is to build a continually-building repository unified under the mantra, "There's a function for that!"
